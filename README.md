## 💡 Why I Built This

> *“I didn't just want to learn Flask — I wanted to create something that matters. Something that feels real.”*

This project started as a small learning goal but quickly turned into something I felt proud of. With every line of code, I imagined a student using it to manage their books… a teacher storing their reading list… a curious mind organizing their ideas.

It’s more than code — it’s about impact. 🌱
